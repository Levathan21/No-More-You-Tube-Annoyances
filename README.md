No More You Tube Annoyances For Ublock Origin 


In Sort this removes some small parts of the you tube website that for most people are not needed.

Most things that are gone are useless icons/options that most people dont use and this can easily be customised by removeing the lines of code that you/ features that you want to keep

This is what it removes:

Remove YT Thumnails (Home Page/Videos Tab ONLY)
Hide Shorts Tab (Home Page) and also community posts from home page
Hide Channel Banners (Also hides channel links)
Removes "Our Members Banner"
Remove Join option
Removes Shorts from channel pages
Remove Fundraiser from video player/You Tube Channel Page
Remove "More from you tube" shelf"
