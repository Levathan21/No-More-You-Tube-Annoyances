# No-More-You-Tube-Annoyances
No More You Tube Annoyances For Ublock Origin 


In Sort this removes some small parts of the you tube website that for most people are not needed.

Most things that are gone are useless icons/options that most people dont use and this can easily be customised by removeing the lines of code that you/ features that you want to keep

This is what it removes:

Remove YT Thumnails (Home Page/Videos Tab ONLY)

Hide Shorts Tab (Home Page) and also community posts from home page

Hide Channel Banners (Also hides channel links)

Removes "Our Members Banner"

Removes Join option

Removes Shorts from channel pages

Removes Fundraiser from video player/You Tube Channel Page

Removes "More from you tube" shelf"


To add this go into the settings of Ublock and go under "My filters" and you can copy the code from the TXT document into it

Have a nice day and happen browseing you tube
